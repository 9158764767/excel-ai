# Privacy Policy for Abhi's Excel Data Analysis GPT

This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when using the Abhi's Excel Data Analysis custom GPT (the "GPT").

## Data Collection

The GPT accepts spreadsheet files (Excel/CSV) and converts them into tabular data for analysis. The data you provide is used solely to perform the requested analysis tasks. No personal information beyond what is contained in the uploaded file is collected.

## Data Usage

Uploaded data is processed by OpenAI’s systems and, if enabled, by Abhi’s backend API to generate summaries, clean data, visualisations, or forecasts. The results are returned to you via the GPT interface. Data is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with third parties.

## Data Storage

The GPT does not permanently store your uploaded files or the analysis results. Files may be temporarily cached by OpenAI’s systems for processing but are deleted after completion of the analysis. Abhi’s backend API (if used) does not store your data unless explicitly configured by you.

## Third‑Party Services

This GPT relies on OpenAI’s platform for AI processing and may call an external API hosted by the GPT creator (Abhi) for additional functionality. These services may log basic request metadata (e.g. IP address, timestamp) for security and analytics.

## Your Consent

By using this GPT, you consent to the collection and use of your data as described above. If you do not agree with the privacy policy, please do not use this GPT.

## Contact

For any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact the GPT creator via the GitHub repository.
